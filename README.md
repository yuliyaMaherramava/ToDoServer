# ToDoServer
The server for the React SPA Todo application serves as the backend component responsible for handling interactions with the database and processing client requests. The following technologies are employed in this server description: body-parser, cors, dotenv, express, express-validator, mongoose, and prettier.

Body-parser: Body-parser is an Express.js middleware that parses the data sent by the client and makes it available as the req.body object. This facilitates convenient access to the request data, such as when creating a new task in the Todo application.

Cors: Cors (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is middleware that allows configuring the security policy for data exchange between the client and server located on different domains. Cors is necessary to allow requests from the Todo client to the server when they are on different ports or domains.

Dotenv: Dotenv is a module that enables loading environment variables from a .env file. In the context of the Todo server, dotenv can be used to store sensitive information like the MongoDB database connection string or API secret key.

Express: Express.js is a popular framework for building web applications on Node.js. It simplifies defining routes, handling requests, and managing middleware. In the case of the Todo application server, Express is used to define API routes, handle requests, and send responses to the client.

Express-validator: Express-validator is Express.js middleware designed for data validation of client inputs. It allows defining validation rules for different request fields and handling input errors. In the context of the Todo server, express-validator can be used to validate and sanitize user input when creating or updating tasks.

Mongoose: Mongoose is a library for working with MongoDB in Node.js. It provides a convenient interface for creating data models, executing database queries, and interacting with MongoDB collections. In the case of the Todo application server, Mongoose can be used to define the task model and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks in the database.
